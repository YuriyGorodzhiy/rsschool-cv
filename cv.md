## Briefly About Myself:

Enrolled in the RSschool course to become the good frontend developer.

I want to pass the selection and to get a job at EPAM.

I strive to obtain new knowledge, consolidate the acquired knowledge and use it in my work.
I take a responsible attitude to the tasks set, and even if they are difficult for me, I will try to understand them and find a solution.

## Skills:

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* MySQL

## Code example:

**_Multiples of 3 or 5_ KATA from CODEWARS:** _Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them). If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once._
```
function solution(number){
  let sum = 0;
  
  for(let i = 1; i < number; i++){
    if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0){
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```
